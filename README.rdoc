= GraphLite

Rails gem for interacting with the Facebook API. This gem is intended
to be a lightweight wrapper that allows you to quickly and easily
interact with the Facebook API. It is not intended to be a full
object wrapper.

This is a work in progress. Use at your own risk.

= Tests
Tests are written using RSpec and provide good sample code. They hit the Facebook API
directly and use example graph objects from the Facebook documentation.
